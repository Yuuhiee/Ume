Plastic Chair***

The standard "white" plastic chair, usually found on porches and patios around the world, but can also be used for indoor decor.  This model is built entirely of quad polygons, and consists of exactly 24,612 polys, and 24,414 verts. The model is available in native .max 2012 scene file format, as well as .obj for use in other applications, like Blender, Poser, or Daz-Studio. ***OBJ USERS, please refer to the instructions below for specific direction on how to load these objects into your scenes.     The .max file also comes with an additional "base model" version on a hidden layer, with modifier stack intact.  It does not contain detail modeling, and can be totally customized as you wish. 

The model is one object, and has been UV unwrapped.  However, no textures accompany the model, nor are any necessary.  Any seamless procedural or tileable texture should work on this object just fine.  I recommend using just a standard plastic material for the best results, and most accurate representation.

*All preview renders were made with the Octane render engine, using only a simple plastic shader.

You are free to use or modify this model as you see fit for your own projects or scenes. As with all my freebies, this model can be used for both commercial and non-commercial renders. You may NOT, however, resell or redistribute these models or textures, or any derivative of them; individually, or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ USERS: There are 3 different OBJ files for this model.  You will notice that two of the three OBJ files are labeled for specific applications (Poser and Blender).  It's recommended to use these in the specific application.  POSER USERS:  The OBJ with (poser) suffix was exported with a scale conversion that will allow the object to load with appropriate scaling into Poser 9 and above, and Daz Studio 4 and above.  To import this file into Poser, please BE SURE to DE-select all the check box options in the OBJ Import Options dialogue box.  DESELECT the "Centered", "Place On Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. so that no options are checked.  This will import the object exactly as intended into the scene, with proper scaling.  DAZ STUDIO users: Select "File/Import", then navigate to the folder on your hard drive that contains the model in this pack.  Choose the "plastic_chair(poser).obj".  In the Import Options dialogue box, pick the Poser (1unit=8ft) option in the FROM dropdown list.  Be sure all other options are checked, and click "Accept".  BLENDER USERS:  Select the "plastic_chair(blender).obj".  All other software packages should import the standard "plastic_chair.obj" without specific suffix.

All textures and UV's were created by me.  Most of the original reference textures were from CGTextures.com texture resource website, as well as other royalty-free texture repositories. You are not allowed to redistribute these textures in any way.  Please refer to CGTextures website for specific restrictions regarding the textures.

Thanks,

John
